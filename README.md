# Tune-Therapy
As an omnipresent art form, music resonates deeply inside the diverse landscapes of human emotions and moods, resulting in a symphony enhanced by historical rituals, therapeutic, and amusement. Whether buried in blues' sad melodies or pop's lively beats, each note recalls a common emotional ability to connect with listeners. The finely prepared playlists that streaming services have become in this technologically advanced day represent the nuanced symphony of listeners' emotional moods and preferences. This convergence represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to apply musical analytics to novel treatment approaches. One can improve personal well-being methods by matching musical offerings in real-time to listeners' emotional currents with more significant musical insights.[4].

``Tune Therapy'' aims to be a beacon of accessibility and use, democratizing music's therapeutic potential in a culture growing more conscious of mental health. This study delves into a novel methodology in which we first evaluate the user's mood by analyzing the songs' lyrics in the playlist. The later module aims to provide a more tailored approach by making personal music recommendations to improve the user's mood based on the predicted mood in the earlier module. This paper aims to anticipate the user's mood with the most remarkable accuracy feasible.
